## Who am I ?
I am Mian Azam Mehmood, Software Development student, a Philomath and great lover of Nature. 
I am originally from Pakistan, and have been here in Winnipeg since September 2021. I am currently studying at Manitoba Institute of Trades and Technology. So far, I have some experience with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and still learning. I am working as a Night Auditor at Canad Inns where I have already work on two other positions of Guest Services Agent and Event Set-Up in last 14 months. 
I love to travel and explore nature, specially lakes and mountains. I wish that if I will only be able to even explore my home country, that will be an achievement.
