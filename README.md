## Who am I ?
I am Mian Azam Mehmood, Software and website developer, a Philomath and great lover of Nature. 

Highly motivated software developer with about one and a half year of intensive project-based academic practical experience. Skilled in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, OOP, APIs, C#, .NET, MVC, ORM, SQL, Microsoft SQL server, Microsoft Visual Studio, VS Code and React.JS. Strong problem- solving and analytical skills, with a passion for staying up-to-date with emerging trends and technologies in the software development industry. Looking for an entry-level software development role to apply my skills and knowledge and to contribute to the success of the team and organization.

I love to travel and explore nature, specially lakes and mountains. I wish that if I will only be able to even explore my home country, that will be an achievement.
